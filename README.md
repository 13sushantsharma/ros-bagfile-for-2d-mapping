# ros-bagfile-for-2d-mapping
This work gives the analysis of the 2D SLAM techniques available in robotics operating system. A laser based study is conducted in order to judge the parametes of the SLAM techniques using a bag file. A ros bagfile was generated and used to maintain uniformity among the inputs provided to the map building SLAM techniques. Maps built and the CPU load were compared and the most effective method was concluded on the basis of the above study. The methods were used for 2D mapping only and were provided with laserscan and wheelodometry . The most basic approach for implementing a SLAM technique is based on the  efficiency and conditions provided to the autonomous robot in order to navigate in a given environment. Thus this study acts as a root for choosing the required SLAM techniques on the basis of their strenghts and weaknesses for a given indoor environment.
